	DGREP - fast egrep clone

Dgrep is a fast Unix egrep clone that works at least in Linux and Windows. 
It is also easy to port to any environment with ANSI C -compiler. Dgrep 
should be quite compatible with old egrep excluding some options.

Dgrep uses two algorithms to search expressions. Literal strings are
searched with the Boyer-Moore algorithm and regular expressions are
searched with a deterministic finite state automata. To speed up the
searches literal strings from the regular expression are also searched
with the Boyer-Moore algorithm. Dgrep uses a lazy evaluation technique
for the deterministic finite state automata, so the state transitions
are calculated only when they are actually needed. 

For more details see dgrep.doc.

By writing just dgrep a shorter help text is displayed and by writing 
dgrep -h the following help is displayed:

Usage: dgrep [options] {-f expression file | [-e] expression} [file...]
Options: -An  n lines after the matching line are printed
         -Bn  n lines before the matching line are printed
         -b   filename is displayed only once before matches
         -c   only a count of matching lines is printed
         -d   only dfa is used for searching
         -i   case insensitive match
         -l   only names of files with matching lines are printed
         -n   each line is preceded by its relative line number in file
         -s   silent mode, nothing is printed except error messages
         -t   all files that contain matches are touched
         -v   all lines but those matching are printed
         -x   exact, all characters in expression are taken literally
         -z   verbose
         -1-9 1-9 lines before and after the matching line are printed
         -e expression, useful when expression begins with -
         -f file that contains expression
Regular expressions:                    .       any single character
*       zero or more repeats            (...)   grouping
+       one or more repeats             ^       beginning of line
?       zero or one repeat              $       end of line
[...]   any character in set            \c     quote special character c
[^...]  any character not in set        |       alternative ("or")


The following table compares the speed of the dgrep and the system
egrep in Bsd Unix. Table includes user- and system-times for a few
tests. Input file was /usr/dict/words:

		dgrep	system egrep
'u.*nix'	0.3u	2.4u
		0.4s	0.3s
'first'		0.2u	2.5u
		0.2s	0.2s
'first|second'	1.8u	2.2u
		0.3s	0.2s

GNU grep version 1.3 and dgrep was compared in a MS-DOS machine. Test
data was dgrep sources read in twice, 32 files and 7544 lines. GNU grep
was used with option -E (== use Egrep syntax).

			GNU egrep	dgrep
    Int			11.8		 8.1
-ic Int			13.4		 8.4
    first|second	28.6		16.9
-c  first|second	19.8		10.8	-- less output
    Unsigned		10.6		 7.9
